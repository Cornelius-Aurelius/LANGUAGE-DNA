# LanguageDNA — English → Spanish Pattern Learning

LanguageDNA teaches Spanish through reusable links between English and Spanish rather than isolated vocabulary lists.

## Current experience

- Beginner-first home screen
- English ↔ Spanish live word translator with subtle pattern detection
- Visual, sound, sentence, verb and question pattern families
- WHO / WHAT / WHERE / WHY / WHEN meaning lenses
- Connected next-pattern links
- Five-skill mastery per pattern: See, Hear, Write, Speak, Use

- Skip and reveal-answer controls with no penalty
- LanguageDNA map showing pattern growth by family and meaning
- Responsive mobile and desktop layouts
- Offline app shell for the pattern library and practice engine

The current starter library contains 60 hand-authored English → Spanish patterns and is designed to expand into a much larger lexical and grammatical graph.

This static HTML/CSS/JavaScript app is deployed with GitHub Pages.

## Full Pattern Dictionaries

Selected high-leverage word-link patterns now open dedicated A–Z dictionary pages with search, pagination, English/Spanish table rows, and a Spanish listen button on every word. Current full dictionaries include `-tion → -ción`, `-ity → -idad`, `-ous → -oso/-osa`, `-ly → -mente`, `ph → f`, `-ic → -ico/-ica`, `-ive → -ivo/-iva`, `-ist → -ista`, and `-ance/-ence → -ancia/-encia`.

### Dictionary expansion

LanguageDNA now includes 31 full Pattern Dictionaries. The WordNet-aligned expansion produced 9,507 candidate pairs; Data Quality v2 serves 8,264 production pairs and quarantines 1,243 unsupported automated candidates for review. All 850 hand-curated pairs are preserved.

## Lexical data pipeline

The Pattern Dictionary data now uses English/Spanish lemmas aligned through Open Multilingual Wordnet: Princeton WordNet on the English side and Multilingual Central Repository Spanish on the Spanish side. Automated candidates are accepted only when they share a synset, match the required part of speech, match an explicit LanguageDNA transformation rule, and pass an orthographic stem-similarity threshold. Hand-curated pairs take priority.

See `DATA_SOURCES.md` and `data-build-report.json` for provenance, licenses, build rules, and per-pattern counts.


## Data Quality v2

The production dictionaries now pass an additional corroboration gate using Spanish Wiktionary-derived lexical data, Spanish UniMorph, and English/Spanish frequency lists. Automated OMW rows with no support from any of those layers are moved to a review queue rather than shown to learners. This reduces the learner-facing set from 9,507 aligned candidates to 8,264 stronger production rows while preserving all 850 hand-curated pairs.

The learner-facing layout is unchanged. See `DATA_QUALITY.md`, `data-quality-report.json`, and `data-review-queue.json` for the audit rules and counts.
